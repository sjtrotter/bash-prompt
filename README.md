# bash-prompt
powerline style bash prompt

copy/paste this at the bottom of your .bashrc, then add this at the bottom:

PROMPT_COMMAND=prompt

You can change the order of the prompt blocks in the PROMPT_ORDER variable.

Working on making this better still, some ideas like:
- using real names to store colors, then setting colors that way
- ... not sure what else yet.
